# Tutorial on Algorithmic Trading

This is another tutorial I finished succesfully. I leared a little about finance and 
a little about some python libraries, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Because
the only thing the teacher does is to use some free API to check some metrics from
S&P stocks, and then build portfolios based on thoese metrics. I was expecting something
more on the tone of TA algorithmic trading, with backtesting.

And the comments on that video are only bots!!!!!
